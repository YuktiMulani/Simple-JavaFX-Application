JavaFX Pizza Ordering App  
This JavaFX desktop application is part of my learning journey for JavaFX. It allows users to order pizzas by selecting size, crust type, and toppings. The application features an intuitive user interface, order summary display, and input validation. Join me as I explore JavaFX and build real-world applications!
